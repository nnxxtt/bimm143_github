In today's class, we will examine some data about candy from the 538 website.

```{r}
read.csv("candy-data.csv")
```

```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.csv"
candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

There are 85 different candy types in the dataset.

There are `r nrow(candy)` in this dataset.

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

> Q. How many chocolate candy types are in the dataset?

There are 37 chocolate candy types in the dataset.

There are `r sum(candy$chocolate)` chocolate candy types in the dataset.

```{r}
sum(candy$chocolate)
```

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

There are 38 fruity candy types in the dataset.

There are `r sum(candy$fruity)` fruity candy types in this dataset.

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

My favorite candy is Snickers, and the winpecent value is 76.67378

```{r}
candy["Snickers", ]$winpercent
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

76.7686

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

49.6535

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```

Installation of the skimr package in order to use the `skim()` function. `install.packages("skimr")`

```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

Winpercent looks to be on a different scale (large whole numbers 0-100 scale) than the majority of the columns in the dataset that seem to be in 0-1 scale/percenatges). Extra: Comparison between the two types would be harder because they are not on the same scale.

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy\$chocolate column?

The zero represents a "no" the candy does not contain chocolate and the 1 represents a "yes" the candy does contain chocolate.

> Q8a. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist((candy$winpercent))
```

> Q8b. Plot a histogram of winpercent values using ggplot

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 7)
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No the distribution is not symmetrical.

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

The center is below 50%.

```{r}
mean(candy$winpercent)
```

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

Chocolate candy is higher ranked with a mean of 60.92153 than fruity candy, which has a mean of 44.11974.

-   first find all chocolate candy
-   find their winpercent values
-   calculate the mean of these values

```{r}
chocolate.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
chocolate.win <- candy[chocolate.inds,]$winpercent
mean(chocolate.win)
```

-   then, do the same for fruity candy and compare with the mean for chocolate candy.

```{r}
fruity.inds <- as.logical(candy$fruity)
fruity.win <- candy[fruity.inds,]$winpercent
mean(fruity.win)
```

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

The difference is statistically significant because of the small p-value of 2.871e-08.

```{r}
t.test(chocolate.win, fruity.win)
```

The order function is very useful for this and it returns the indices that make the input sorted. \> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets,Super Bubble, and Jawbusters are the five least liked candy types in this set.

```{r}
inds<- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,])
```

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

Reese's Peanut Butter cup, Reese's Miniatures, Twix, Kit Kat, and Snickers are the top 5 all time favorite candy types of this set.

```{r}
tail(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy),) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
ggsave("mybarplot.png", height=10)
```

![Exported image that is a little bigger so that I can read it](mybarplot.png)

I will add colors to my barplot

```{r}
my_cols=rep("grey", nrow(candy))
my_cols[candy$fruity == 1] <- "pink"
my_cols[candy$chocolate ==1] <- "chocolate"
my_cols[candy$caramel ==1] <- "brown"
my_cols[candy$bar ==1] <- "orange"
my_cols
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy),) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols)
```

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Plot of winpercent vs pricepercent

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text(col=my_cols) 
```

There are just too many labels in the plot above, and it is not readable. We can use the `ggrepel` package to do a better job of placing labels so thry minimize text overlap

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 5, size=3.3) 
```

## Exploring the correlation structure

```{r}
library(corrplot)

cij <- cor(candy)
cij
```

```{r}
corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and fruity are anti-correlated. Chocolate is not correlated with fruity

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Chocolate and or chocolate and winpercent are positively correlated.Chocolate is correlated with winpercent.

## 6. Principal Component Analysis

We will preform a PCA for the candy. Key-question: Do we need to scale the data before PCA? yes because the winpercent is on a different scale (0-100 insteadl fo 0-1).

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale= TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```

Make a ggplot version of this figure:

```{r}
# Make a new data-frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
my_data
head(my_data)
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)
p
```

Make this a bit nicer

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```

```{r}
#library(plotly)
#ggplotly(p)
```

How do the origional variables contribute to our PCs? For this we need to look at the loadings component of our results object i.e. the `pca$rotation` object.

```{r}
head(pca$rotation)
```

Make a barplot with ggplot and order the bars by their value. Recall that you need a data.frame as input for ggplot

```{r}
res <- as.data.frame(pca$rotation)
row.names(res)
ggplot(res)+
  aes(PC1, reorder(row.names(res), PC1)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruit, Pluribus, and hard are all picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction. This makes sense based on the correlation structure in the dataset. If it is a fruit candy, it will tend to be hard and come in a packet with multiple candies(pluribus).
